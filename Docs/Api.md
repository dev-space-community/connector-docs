# API connector User Documentation

## Overview

The `API Connector` is a flexible and user-friendly utility designed to facilitate the integration of APIs within our products **ACE Search** and **Chat**. It abstracts the complexities of HTTP requests, authentication, and error handling, allowing users to fetch data from APIs and convert the responses into knowledge objects seamlessly.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Handling of Authentication**: Supports Bearer tokens and Basic Authentication based on provided inputs.
- **Flexible Input Handling**: Safely parses JSON strings for headers and body.
- **Error Handling**: Captures and raises detailed exceptions for common HTTP errors.
- **Integration**: Converts API responses into knowledge objects with relevant metadata.

## User Guide

### Initialization

To create an instance of the `APIConnector` class, you need to provide various parameters that define how the API request should be made. Below is a guide on how to fill out these details.

### Parameters

- **Endpoint** (str, required):  
  The URL of the API endpoint you want to access.

- **Username** (str, optional):  
  The username for Basic Authentication. Must be provided together with the `password`.

- **Password** (str, optional):  
  The password for Basic Authentication. Must be provided together with the `username`.

- **Headers** (str, optional):  
  HTTP headers to be included in the request. This can be provided as a JSON string or as a dictionary. If you use a JSON string, it will be automatically parsed into a dictionary.

  Query parameters for the request. This can be provided as a JSON string or as a dictionary.

- **Body** (str, optional):  
  The body of the request, typically used for POST requests. This can be provided as a JSON string or as a dictionary.

  The HTTP method to use for the request (e.g., GET, POST). The default is `GET`.

- **Timeout** (int, optional):  
  The timeout duration for the request in seconds. If not provided, the request will use the default timeout.

- **Proxies** (str, optional):  
  Proxy servers to route the request through. This can be provided as a JSON string.

- **Verify** (str, optional):  
  Whether to verify SSL certificates. This can be provided as a string (`True` or `False`).

- **Cookies** (str, optional):  
  Cookies to include in the request. This can be provided as a JSON string or as a dictionary.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how you might fill in the parameters:

1. **Endpoint**:  
  `https://api.example.com/data`

2. **Authentication Token**:  
  `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`

3. **Username**:
