# APIConnector User Documentation

## Overview

The `APIConnector` class is a flexible and user-friendly utility designed to facilitate the integration of APIs within our products **ACE Search** and **Chat**. It abstracts the complexities of HTTP requests, authentication, and error handling, allowing users to fetch data from APIs and convert the responses into knowledge objects seamlessly.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Handling of Authentication**: Supports Bearer tokens and Basic Authentication based on provided inputs.
- **Flexible Input Handling**: Safely parses JSON strings for headers and body.
- **Error Handling**: Captures and raises detailed exceptions for common HTTP errors.
- **Integration**: Converts API responses into knowledge objects with relevant metadata.

## User Guide
