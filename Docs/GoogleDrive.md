## Working with Nested Folders

If you have nested folders and want to extract data from specific folders:

1. Share the parent folder with the service account.
2. Create multiple connectors with folder paths.
   - For example, create one connector with `Test/folder1` and another with `Test/folder2`.
   - Alternatively, you can share both folders with the service account and provide their names in separate knowledge entries.
